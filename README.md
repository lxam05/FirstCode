This is a simple program using 4 4D arrays in c
The user is asked questions about their living situation and how much energy and water they use and the age of their house
Based off of this information the program uses the users inputs as indexing to accurately locate the overall sustainability level of their house
I used enums as they proved to be much easier to track while inputting
